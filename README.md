# Link-Them-All
Link Them All game created in Unity3d.


# How it works?
1. After creation of all the tiles after initilaiztion, use Shuffle() to shuffle the tokens.
2. Use CheckCanLink(TileA, TileB) to check if two tiles can be linked legally.
3. Use CheckValidLinkExists() to check if there is any legal linkage existing in the current game.
